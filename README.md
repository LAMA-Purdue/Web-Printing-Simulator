# Web Based 3D Printing Simulator

This (hacked together) code shows a (very) rough visualization of a laser parsing and building a gcode file uploaded by a user.

[Try it out here](https://lama-purdue.github.io/Web-Printing-Simulator/), pick any .gcode file and orbit around the scene with your arrow keys.


## TODO:
- Draw lines between points, using extruder commands as pen up/pen down
- Add support for Z axis commands
- Add a "recoater" blade that moves before every Z command
